# Project Two Airgead Bank Program

The Airgead banking Investment Calculator program I created for project 2 is designed for users to simulate and understand their financial growth through investments. It addresses the need for a tool that calculates and vusualizes investment scenarios based on initial investment, monthly deposits, annual interest rates, and investment duration in years. The program provides users with detailed year-end balances and earned interests, allowing them to compare different investment strategies and make informed financial decisions. While developing this project, I believe I did a few things particularily well. My code maintains a clear and organized structure, leveraging object-oriented programming principles with classes like 'InvestmentCalculator' for encapsulating data and methods. Input validation is robust, ensuring that user inputs are sanitized and errors are managed gracefully, enhancing the reliability of the program. Modular design and in-line comments contribute to readability and maintainablility, making it easier for future developers to understand and extend the codebase. However, there are areas where enhancements could be made. Improving error handling to anticipate and manage edge cases more effectively would enhacne the robustness of my program. Optimiaztion of calculations, particularily for large datasets or extended investment periods, would improve performance. Strengthening security measures, such as implementing data validation techniques, would fortify the program against potential vulnerabilites. The most challenging aspects of this project involved managing vectors for storing year-end data and ensuring accurate calculation of compound interest across monthly and yearly periods. Overcoming these challenges required careful algorthimic design and testing, leveraging C++'s vector operations for efficient data management. The skills I gained from this project, including oject-oriented design, input/output handling, and algorthimic thinking, are all highly transferable skills. They can be applied to future projects in software development, finance, or data analysis where structure, reliability, and effiecient computation is essential.
